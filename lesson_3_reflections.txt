When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Multiple users(collaboration), multiple work sites/input devices, big project with multiple branches.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Awareness what changes to code being used when pulling versus possibility
being unaware when other users modified and pushed code into repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks are used exclusively on GitHub and are used to make a clone of a
repository( possibly someone else's) to you GitHub space. Clones are copies
brought down from GitHub or other remote http site to local machine. Branches
are made off of repositories for reasons such as testing experimental
changes.
