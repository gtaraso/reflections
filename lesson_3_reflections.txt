When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Multiple users(collaboration), multiple work sites/input devices, big project with multiple branches.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Awareness what changes to code being used when pulling versus possibility
being unaware when other users modified and pushed code into repository.
