How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Helped me notice subtle differences between files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Helps you find specific changes to file to determine why behavior of program
changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?
 pros - logical commit points, appropriate change sizes. cons - could forget
to save changes invidually (vs along with other changes), might automatically
save changes when walk away or during editing.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?
	Git meant for larger projects and computer code, whereas Docs might
handle smaller, English lanaguage-based files.

How can you use commands like git log and git diff to view the history of
files?
	Git log shows changes made saved iterations of files. Git diff can be
used to show differences between different versions.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	Because could always revert to working repository (with earlier commit
id).
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git
for?
   Same as before - version control.
